            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p id="name">My name is Eric Cheng. I grew up in Rochester, New York. I got my Bachelor's degree at CUNY Baruch College in New York City. At Baruch College, I majored in Computer Information System and minored in Journalism. I moved to Boston in the fall of 2018 with the inital plan of getting my Master's degree in Computer Information System at Boston University. However, I am currently taking a two-year break and am currently taking courses at Bunker Hills Community College. 
            I decided to do that because I want to be able to improve my programming skills at a slower pace and I feel that Bunker Hills Community College will help me better than Boston University. However, when I do finish my education at Bunker Hills Community College, I may decide to go back to Boston University to finish my Master's Degree.</p>

        <div class="chess">
            <h2>Chess is Awesome</h2>
            <p id="game">During my free time, I like to play chess. I love chess because there are endless possibilities that can be found in different games of chess. It is also a great way to meet new people and make new friends. There are always new strategies and techniques to learn. Chess can also be stressful because there is so much thinking and calculation involved when deciding what your plan should be.
